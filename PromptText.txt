I already have a blank solution created called UltimakeMonitor. And loaded in VS2026 Insider preview
Guide me through the adding projects to this solution so that Aspire can be used that has an Razor Website and the necessary projects, to create a monitoring website for monitoring all Ultimaker 3D printers on my network.

I want on the Index page (Home page) cards that represents all found printers and their state. And when i click on that card, i want to popup a much bigger card, with as much of possible data and states of that printer.
I want all css that is specific for a cshtml file be in a behind file. for example Index.cshtml and Index.cshtml.css, so just like the code behind files.
I want you to show me the step step by step, and explain why you do that step, and wait for me for the next step unitl i have implemented that step and have no more questions about it.


What we've built so far:
1.	Aspire-based architecture with Web frontend and API backend
2.	Service discovery - no hardcoded URLs
3.	Background service for printer monitoring
4.	Real-time updates with auto-refresh
5.	Responsive UI with Bootstrap
6.	Modal dialogs for detailed views
7.	Simulated printer data for testing
Potential next features to implement:
1.	Real Ultimaker API integration - Replace simulation with actual printer communication
2.	Database persistence - Store printer history and statistics
3.	Email/SMS alerts - Notify when prints complete or fail
4.	Multi-user support - User accounts and permissions
5.	Print history - Track completed jobs
6.	Material tracking - Monitor filament usage
7.	Export reports - Generate CSV/PDF reports
8.	Dark mode - UI theme switching
9.	Mobile app - Using .NET MAUI
10.	SignalR integration - Real-time push updates instead of polling
Which feature would you like to implement next, or would you prefer to polish the existing functionality?
